    type: "veg",
    tips: "For perfect Ragi Sangati, ensure the consistency of the mixture is neither too watery nor too hard by adjusting the water as needed. Stir continuously while adding the ragi paste to prevent lumps from forming. Use fresh ragi flour for the best flavor and texture, as stale flour can affect the taste. Beginners may find it helpful to include rice in the recipe, as it makes achieving the right consistency easier and provides a smoother texture. For a gluten-free option, skip the rice and adjust the water accordingly. Lastly, serving Ragi Sangati hot with a dollop of ghee enhances its flavor and makes it even more satisfying."

    tips: "For the best Ragi Java, ensure you use fresh ragi flour for optimal taste and nutrition. Stir continuously while adding the ragi paste to boiling water to prevent lumps and achieve a smooth consistency. Adjust the water-to-ragi ratio based on whether you prefer a thicker porridge or a thinner drink. Sweeten with jaggery instead of sugar for a healthier and more traditional flavor, and consider adding cardamom powder for a pleasant aroma. For a savory version, skip the jaggery and sugar, and season with a pinch of salt and a touch of ghee. Always serve it warm for maximum comfort and enjoyment."

    process:
      "To prepare Sabudana Khichdi, start by rinsing 1 cup of sabudana thoroughly under running water to remove excess starch, then soak it in just enough water to cover the pearls for 4–6 hours or overnight until soft. Once soaked, ensure the sabudana is non-sticky and separate. Roast 1/4 cup of peanuts, cool them, and coarsely grind. Boil, peel, and dice one medium potato. Heat 2 tablespoons of ghee or oil in a pan, add 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds, and let them splutter. Add 1–2 finely chopped green chilies and a few curry leaves (optional), sautéing briefly. Toss in the diced potato and stir for 1–2 minutes. Add the soaked sabudana, ground peanuts, salt, and 1 teaspoon of sugar (optional), mixing gently. Cook on low-medium heat for 5–7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sabudana turns translucent. Finish with 1 teaspoon of lemon juice and garnish with fresh coriander leaves. Serve hot with yogurt or tea for a comforting meal.",
    type: "veg",
    tips: "For the perfect Sabudana Khichdi, it’s important to soak the sabudana properly—ensure the water level is just enough to cover the pearls, as too much water can make it sticky. After soaking, the sabudana should be soft and separate, not clumpy. Roasting the peanuts well adds a delightful crunch and flavor, so don't skip that step. While cooking, stir gently to avoid breaking the sabudana and ensure it doesn’t become mushy. A small amount of sugar balances the spices from the green chilies and enhances the overall flavor, though it’s optional based on personal preference. Lastly, serve the khichdi immediately after cooking as it tends to harden when cooled. For the best taste, enjoy it fresh with a side of yogurt or a cup of tea."

Once cooked, add jaggery or sugar to sweeten the drink, stirring until it dissolves. For added flavor, mix in a pinch of cardamom powder, and if you prefer a creamier texture, add 1/4 cup of milk and cook for another 2–3 minutes.

    type: "veg",
    tips: "For the best Sabudana Java, ensure the sabudana is soaked properly so that it cooks evenly and doesn’t become sticky. The soaking time should be just long enough to soften the pearls without excess water, which can make it clumpy. Adjust the water-to-sabudana ratio based on your preferred consistency—use less water for a thicker drink and more water for a thinner one. When sweetening, jaggery provides a richer taste than sugar and adds a natural sweetness, though sugar works fine if preferred. Adding a pinch of cardamom enhances the aroma, and saffron can be used for extra flavor and color. For a creamier texture, milk or ghee can be added, but these are optional, especially if you prefer a vegan version. Always serve the Java warm for the best experience."

For extra flavor, add finely chopped onions, green chilies, and coriander leaves directly into the batter.

Adding a little oil or melted butter to the marinade will help the paneer crisp up while grilling. Preheat your grill or oven to medium-high heat for even cooking and a nice char. If you're using wooden skewers, soak them in water beforehand to avoid burning. Alternate the paneer with vegetables like bell peppers and onions on the skewers for added flavor. While grilling, baste the paneer with oil or butter to keep it moist and golden. For the best results, serve the Paneer Tikka immediately after grilling while it's still hot and crispy.

      "To make homemade pasta, start by combining 2 cups of all-purpose flour (and 1/2 cup semolina flour for a firmer texture) in a mound on a clean surface. Create a well in the center and add 2 beaten eggs, 1 tablespoon of olive oil, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Using a fork, gently whisk the eggs, slowly incorporating the flour from the edges until the mixture starts to form a dough. Once the dough comes together, knead it for about 8-10 minutes, adding water a little at a time if it's too dry or extra flour if it's too sticky. Once smooth and elastic, cover the dough and let it rest for at least 30 minutes. After resting, divide the dough into portions, then roll each portion out into a thin sheet (about 1-2 mm thick) using a rolling pin or pasta machine. Cut the dough into your desired pasta shape, such as fettuccine, tagliatelle, or pappardelle, and dust with flour to prevent sticking.
